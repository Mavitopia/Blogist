# Digital Tavern v1.1

A **blogging site** styled like a classic old‑school RPG.  
Built as an experiment to test current web‑development skills with Node.js and Express.

## ⚔️ Project Overview

Digital Tavern recreates the look and feel of a medieval RPG inn—complete with pixel‑art menus and fantasy fonts—to offer a playful but functional blogging experience.
