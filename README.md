# 📝 Blogging Sites – Experimental Projects

Welcome to my **blogging sites experiment repository**.  
This space serves as a playground where I test and expand my web development skills by building various versions of blogging platforms over time.

Each project here captures my learning journey through experimentation with UI design, routing, templating, and user interaction using **Node.js**, **Express**, and other lightweight tools.  
> ⚠️ These are primarily frontend-focused builds with no full backend implemented—for now.

## 📌 Current Versions in This Repository

### 🔹 Version 1.0  
- My **initial attempt** at creating a blogging site  
- Simple and minimalistic: basic layout and post display system  
- Limited interactivity and styling—serves as a learning baseline  

---

### 🔹 Version 1.1 – *Digital Tavern*  
- A more advanced iteration  
- Features a fantasy/RPG-inspired theme with pixel art UI elements

> ⚠️ **Note:** These projects are experimental and meant for learning purposes only.  
> They all contain bugs and other imperfections that I may fix in future versions, but for now, these remain as-is.  
> Both versions work fine, though Version 1.1 is clearly better built, it still has many issues and I have lost motivation to continue it—for now. Maybe I will return in Version 1.2 <fire>
